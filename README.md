# Spring Boot API - People Management

This project is a powerful and efficient REST API built using Spring Boot. It is designed to handle the management of people in a structured database, enabling smooth CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The API follows best practices to ensure reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

## âœ¨ What This Project Does
- Provides a structured way to **register new people** in the database.
- Allows **retrieving a list of all registered people** with ease.
- Enables **searching for a specific person by their unique ID**.
- Supports **updating a person's information**, ensuring data accuracy.
- Offers **deletion of records**, keeping the database clean and organized.
- Includes **advanced search and filtering options**, such as ordering by name, filtering by specific criteria, and summing up total ages.

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **A user sends a request** to create, retrieve, update, or delete a person.
2. **The API processes the request**, ensuring data validation and consistency.
3. **The database is updated** or queried based on the request type.
4. **A response is returned**, confirming the success or failure of the operation.

This project is ideal for developers looking for a solid and well-structured Spring Boot API to manage people records in a modern and efficient way.
